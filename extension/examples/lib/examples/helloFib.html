<h1>Hello world with Fibonacci!</h1>

<p>
    This first example should explain the most basic techniques used in 
    jsreport. 
</p>

<p>
    Assembling reports in jsreport is based on javascript templating engines. 
    You define a xml template like this one with special tags and jsreport will
    render report output for you. Output can be html, pdf and others will come.  
    This example is rendering simple html, but you will learn about other output
    formats in the next examples.
</p>

<p>
    In the integrated templated designer is the template on the left side. You
    can find a preview of the final report on the right side. Using "Run" butotn
    from the toolbar will invoke post to the jsreport server and displays the
    output in the previe. Go ahead and try it!
</p>

<p>
    Every jsrender template contains a html and javascript helpers. This 
    comes from basic concepts of javascript templating engines. The html
    contains the report design and the helpers can contain any javascript function
    that can do the some computations required in the report.
</p>

<p>
    Enought of theory, go now and check out the next example rendering 
    fibonacci table.
</p>

<table border="1">  
    <th>n-position</th>
    <th>fib value</th>
   
    <!-- we can call helper functions in jsrender using ~ -->
    {{for ~fibSequence(10)}}
    <tr style="

     background-color:#DD66{{:#data.i}}0">
        <!-- #data is floating context that is always referencing current
            item source.
            --> 
        <td>{{:#data.i}}</td>
        <td>{{:#data.val}}</td>
    </tr>    
    {{/for}}
