# jsreport v2

## Breaking changes

### Node 8
The jsreport v2 requires at least node.js >= 8.6

### Phantom-pdf
Std jsreport v2 installation includes chrome-pdf recipe instead of the phantom-pdf. However you can easily additionally install phantom-pdf recipe back and avoid migration to the chrome recipe.

### Scripts

#### Entity
Rendering request with script strictly accepts format
```js
{ template: { scripts: [{shortid: 'xxx', content: 'xxx'}]}
```
Where each script needs to be identified by `shortid` or contain direct `content`.

The long time deprecated format `request.template.scriptId` or
`request.template.script` is no longer supported.

#### Script content
The custom script hook needs to expect parameters `req, res, done` or `req, res`.

```js
function beforeRender(req, res, done) {
  done()
}
```

The long time deprecated hooks with single `done` parameter or scripts declared as code in global scope is no longer supported.

#### Rendering from script

Using `req.reporter.render` is no longer supported. Instead you need to use:

```js
// TODO promises
const proxy = require('jsreport-proxy')
function beforeRender(req, res, done) {
  proxy.render({ template: {...}}, function (err, res) {
    done()
  })
}
```

### Images
Images extension is no longer part of the std jsreport installation and it is also not being maintained. Use more powerful assets extension instead.

### Fop
Fop recipe is no longer part of the std jsreport installation, however you can easily additionally install it.

### Logging
The logging no longer supports deprecated structure with `providerName`. The only currently supported structure is

```js
"logger": {
	"console": {
		"transport": "console",
		"level": "debug"
	},
	"file": {
		"transport": "file",
		"level": "info",
		"filename": "logs/reporter.log"
	},
	"error": {
		"transport": "file",
		"level": "error",
		"filename": "logs/error.log"
	}
},
```

### Data
Remove references to old `req.template.data.dataJson` support

### Scheduling
Month format of cron expressions is changed from `0-11` to `1-12` to match standard cron expressions.

Day of Week now also supports specifying `7` as Sunday, format changed from `0-6` to `0-7`, where both `0` and `7` represent Sunday.

Cron expressions are now validated to contain at least 5 or 6 parts, so expressions like `* *` or `* * *` are invalid now.

Internal cron parser changed from [node-cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron) to [cron-parser](https://github.com/harrisiirak/cron-parser) package

### Node.js Client
`render` method now returns a promise instead of accepting a callback.

`render` no longer resolves to an instance of [node.js http response stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), instead it resolves to a stream with the same properties of a [node.js http response stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), it is identical with the same properties, just that it is no longer a real instance of [node.js http response stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).
